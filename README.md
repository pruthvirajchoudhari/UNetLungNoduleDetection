# UNetLungNoduleDetection
Pulmonary Lung Nodule Segmentation and Detection from CT Scans using U-Net

The proposed method here improves the lung nodule CAD systems by providing the efficient segmentation and detection of the pulmonary lung nodules from the CT scans. It provides the step by step method in reduction of the false positives in order to improve the accuracy of the system. To precisely locate the nodules, the intensity value based pre-processing is done along with the implementation of state-of-art U-Net image segmentation and an added CNN to further reduce the false positives.
